Code-Dash is a JavaScript and CSS quiz game designed to challenge and educate novice coders on the fundamentals of programming. The interactive nature of the game encourages rapid and confident responses, fostering a hands-on learning experience. Drawing from my background as an educator, I developed this game to inject fun into the learning process and engage learners through interactive questioning.

#Future Enhancements

In the future, I aspire to implement various enhancements and stretch goals for the game. These include, but are not limited to, integrating coins as a currency system to enhance the gaming experience, introducing a timer for each question to add an element of urgency and interactivity,  thereby adding a positive pressure that enriches the gameplay.
